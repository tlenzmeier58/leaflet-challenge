### The objective of this challenge is to map out earthquake activity. Data is provided by the USGS: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. Tectonic plates are provided by "fraxen" on GitHub: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates


### The following steps were done:
1. Import & visualize the data based on latitude & longitude.
1. Delineate the earthquakes by size & depth.
    1. Earthquakes with higher magnitude should sppear larger.
    1. Greater depth should appear darker in color.
1. Include pop-ups that provide additonal information about the earthquake.
1. Createa legend that will provide context for the map data.
1. Import & visualize earthquake data traced by tectonic plates.
1. Add other base maps to choose from.
1. Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
1. Add layer controls.
